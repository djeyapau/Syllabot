		"catalog_description": "Computing applications hosted on dynamically-scaled virtual resources available as services are considered. Collaborative and non-collaborative 'cloud-resident' applications are analyzed with respect to cost, device/location independence, scalability, reliability, security, and sustainability. Commercial and local cloud architectures are examined. A group-based integration of course topics will result in a project employing various cloud computing technologies.",
		"objective": "Each successful student will be able to demonstrate building and running cloud-based services on a large scale. They will gain the knowledge of deploying and managing elastic and cloud based applications on industry standard platforms as well as opensource platforms. Students will be prepared with knowledge of Cloud Based Operations and Application Development.",
		"outcome": ["Students completing this course will be able to:", "Be able to explain the fundamental aspects of IaaS", "Use and administer Industry Standard cloud resources", "Build and deploy your own elastic scaling application on a cloud platform", "Be able to explain the difference between scale up vs scale out architecture", "Understand how to design for services and not servers."]

	"student_responsibility": "Class attendance and active participation are essential if students are to receive maximum benefit from the class. Participation require preparation including completion of reading, labs, assignments and exams by the due dates. If you cannot attend class or complete assignments, labs, or exams on time, please let the instructor know beforehand so that we can discuss alternative strategies. It is the student’s benefit to use their time wisely whether it is in preparation for class, during scheduled class, or in the lab. When students are in any IIT lab environment, they should abide by the college policies. Questions and comments are welcome.",
	"academic_policy": "Any violations of IIT policies regarding academic honesty and or integrity will be referred automatically to the appropriate college authorities for disposition. Please see appropriate pages in the college catalog for definitions and regulations. The minimum penalty for cheating will be a zero for all parties involved on that exam, assignment, lab or quiz. Bottom line: don’t do it.",

No more than thirty-three percent of material included in any paper may be direct quotes. Students have submitted plagiarized material to me frequently over the last five years and I will not tolerate it. If you submit plagiarized material you can expect to receive a grade of ZERO for the assignment, and it may result in your expulsion from the course with a failing grade as per the *IIT Code of Academic Honesty* found in the IIT Student Handbook.",
